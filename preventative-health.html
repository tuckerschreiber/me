<p>Lately, I have been reflecting on preventative healthcare, particularly on lifestyle changes to maintain good health.</p>

<p>In my experience here in Canada, it has been difficult to get regular check-ups, screenings, and even something as simple as getting bloodwork done. It is unclear to me why this is the case.</p>

<p>For instance, if I need to get some bloodwork done to check my hormone levels, it is almost impossible. I could go to a walk-in clinic and be turned away because I do not have any underlying reasons to do so other than my genuine curiosity. I could also schedule an appointment with my family doctor, but it can take weeks or even months to get one. Additionally, my family doctor may not be available, and I have to deal with one of their nurses. Alternatively, I could use an online service and pay $50-$100 just to get a requisition to have my bloodwork done.</p>
