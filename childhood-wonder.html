As I've grown older, I've noticed that I've lost my childhood wonder. Lately, I've been actively trying to rediscover it. For so long, my focus has been on day-to-day problems, responsibilities, email, chores, family, bills, health, and scrolling through news feeds. Unfortunately, this is just a part of being an adult.

However, by giving myself time and space, I'm discovering childhood wonder in the most unexpected places. For instance, taking the bus out of town to visit family reminds me of the long summer days I'd spend outside with friends. The smells of someone's garden can transport me back to my childhood town where I'd ride my bike around all day. Even something as simple as a walk on a trail can prompt memories of spending hours playing in my grandparents backyard.

When I was younger, I would blog, create websites, and just explore my interests wherever they’d take me. That led me to a career in technology and building my own startup. Now, I’m starting that exploration again and hope to find something that can bring that feeling of childhood wonder to my work – which is part of the motivation behind starting to write.

Everyone can find a renewed sense of wonder and appreciation. You just have to take the time to look for it.
