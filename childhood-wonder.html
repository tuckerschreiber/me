<p>As I&#39;ve grown older, I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;ve lost my childhood wonder. Lately, I&#39;ve been actively trying to rediscover it. For so long, my focus has been on day-to-day problems, responsibilities, email, chores, family, bills, health, and scrolling through news feeds. Unfortunately, this is just a part of being an adult.</p>

<p>However, by giving myself time and space, I&#39;m discovering childhood wonder in the most unexpected places. For instance, taking the bus out of town to visit family reminds me of the long summer days I&#39;d spend outside with friends. The smells of someone&#39;s garden can transport me back to my childhood town where I&#39;d ride my bike around all day. Even something as simple as a walk on a trail can prompt memories of spending hours playing in my grandparents backyard.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I would blog, create websites, and just explore my interests wherever they&rsquo;d take me. That led me to a career in technology and building my own startup. Now, I&rsquo;m starting that exploration again and hope to find something that can bring that feeling of childhood wonder to my work &ndash; which is part of the motivation behind starting to write.</p>

<p>Everyone can find a renewed sense of wonder and appreciation. You just have to take the time to look for it.</p>
