<p>I started creating content on TikTok a few weeks ago, and it&rsquo;s been a lot of fun. My videos are simple; I record myself eating and reviewing food that I order on UberEats. Since starting, I&rsquo;ve grown the account to a few thousand followers, and hundreds of thousands of views. I&rsquo;ve also had a few restaurants and companies reach out to ask if I&rsquo;ll review their food.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed doing this because a) I love food b) I like editing video and c) it feels like it will eventually be a skill that translates well into new opportunities.</p>
